            <h2>Welcome to Baguio City: The Summer Capital of the Philippines : Past Meets Present</h2>
                <p>Nestled in the cool mountains of Northern Luzon, Baguio City has long been a beloved destination for travelers seeking respite from the heat of the lowlands.
                Known as the "Summer Capital of the Philippines," this charming city has transformed dramatically over the decades, blending its rich history with modern-day vibrancy </p>
            
            <h2>Then and Now</h2>
                <p>Once a quiet retreat for American colonial officers, Baguio has grown into a bustling hub that still maintains its serene, cool atmosphere. From the days when it was first established in 1900, Baguio's landscape has evolved—from the rustic beauty of the pine-clad hills to the lively streets lined with cafés, shops, and cultural landmarks. The city's old-fashioned charm, like the iconic Burnham Park and the picturesque Mines View Park, coexists alongside the urbanization that brings modern conveniences, shopping malls, and a dynamic culinary scene.

                But despite its growth, Baguio has never lost touch with the natural beauty that once earned it its fame. Today, the city is a fusion of old and new: lush forests remain at its heart, offering peaceful escapes amidst the bustling urban environment. Whether you’re strolling along its historic streets, enjoying its cool climate, or indulging in local delicacies, Baguio is a city where the past and present seamlessly come together.
                
                Join us as we explore the stories, the sights, and the experiences that have shaped Baguio into the dynamic city it is today—a place that celebrates its heritage while embracing the future.</p>
